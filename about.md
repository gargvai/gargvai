<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the UC3M-Santander Big Data Institute in Getafe, Madrid. My academic journey began with a Master’s degree in Information and Communication Technology from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, completed in 2012. This was followed by a Doctorate in Signal Processing from the University of Cantabria in Santander, which I earned in 2021.</p>

<p>Originally from India, I have spent over five years, from January 2013 until February 2018, teaching as an assistant professor at various engineering institutes and universities in India. This teaching experience, combined with over two years of post-PhD research, has given me a well-rounded perspective on both the theoretical and practical aspects of technology and engineering.</p>

<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of Signal Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. I am passionate about leveraging these fields to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. In my research, I rely heavily on software tools like MATLAB and Python to develop and implement innovative solutions.</p>
